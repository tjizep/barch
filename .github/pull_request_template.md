We have benchmarks, please consider running them: We expect you to run our benchmarks if you make claims with respect to the performance.


Make sure that you have [docker installed and running](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on your system. Most Linux distributions support docker though some (like RedHat) have the equivalent (Podman). Users of Apple systems may want to [consider OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev). You do not need to be familiar with docker, you just need to make sure that you are have it running.

If you are unable to format the code, we may format it for you.
