# Done

Finished entries from `TODO.md`, newest last. Each records what was actually found,
which is not always what the original entry predicted.

## 1. Out of bounds read in both glob matchers [26-07-2026]

*Was `TODO.md` entry 5.*

`glob.cpp` read one byte past the end of the pattern in four places, not the two the
original entry described. The star run collapse and the trailing star loop each
appear in both `asterisk_impl` and `stringmatchlen_impl`:

```c
while (patternLen && pattern[1] == '*')   // guarded patternLen, not index 1
while (*pattern == '*')                   // no guard at all
```

Now `patternLen > 1 && pattern[1] == '*'` and `patternLen && *pattern == '*'`.

The read was not the whole problem. When the byte past the end happened to be `*`,
the loop consumed it and drove `patternLen` to 0 or -1. A negative length reads as
truthy in `while (patternLen && stringLen)`, and `if (patternLen == 0 && stringLen ==
0) return 1` then never fires, so matches silently became misses and a negative
length propagated into the recursive call. Unfixed, 12 of 16 probes gave the wrong
answer.

Covered by stage 5 of `test/globdifftest.cpp`. It carries expected answers rather
than comparing the two implementations, because both matchers shared the bug - stages
1 to 4 report zero disagreements on the unfixed code, so a differential could never
have found it. Two passes are needed:

- string literals with a hostile trailing `*`, which reproduce the wrong answer
  deterministically in any build but stay invisible to a sanitizer, since a literal
  `"**"` is three bytes and index 1 is still owned memory
- exactly sized `new char[len]` buffers, where index `len` lands in a redzone. This
  pass asserts nothing about the result, because the neighbouring byte is arbitrary;
  it exists only so a sanitizer build has something to trap

Verified both ways against a copy of the unfixed file: unfixed gives 12 wrong answers
and an ASAN `heap-buffer-overflow` in `asterisk_impl`, fixed gives neither.

One expectation in the original probe set was wrong and was corrected rather than
"fixed" in the code: `*` does not match an empty subject. The main loop is `while
(patternLen && stringLen)`, so with an empty subject it never runs and only an empty
pattern returns 1. That is stock redis behaviour.

## 2. VALUES globs over values and answers with keys [26-07-2026]

*Was `TODO.md` entry 6.*

Confirmed intended, no code change. `VALUES 3` matches the value `"3"` and replies
with `solo:only`, the key holding it - it is the inverse lookup `KEYS` cannot do.
`COUNT` replaces the reply with the number of matches.

The question was raised because `replyshapetest.py` had been written against observed
behaviour, so the assertions could equally have been recording a bug. They are now a
specification, and the test comment says so.

The behaviour was also missing from the command's own documentation: the block above
`VALUES` in `barch.cpp` said "match against all values using a glob pattern" without
mentioning that the reply is keys, which is the surprising half. That is now written
down where someone reading the implementation will see it.

## 3. HELLO implemented for RESP2, protocol 3 refused with NOPROTO [26-07-2026]

*Was `TODO.md` entry 7.*

`HELLO` did not exist, so barch answered `unknown command` to the handshake every
modern redis client opens with. redis-py sends it whenever the protocol is not 2, and
a newer release flipped `DEFAULT_RESP_VERSION` from 2 to 3, which is what broke CI:
the failure was at connect, before any test command ran.

`HELLO` now lives in `barch.cpp` and is registered in `barch_apis.cpp` under the
`connection` category. It answers `HELLO` and `HELLO 2` with the usual handshake
fields as a flat array, which is how RESP2 carries a map - `server`, `version`,
`proto`, `id`, `mode`, `role` and an empty `modules` array. Anything outside protocol
2 is refused with `NOPROTO unsupported protocol version`, and a non numeric version
with `Protocol version is not an integer or out of range`, both matching redis's own
wording. `SETNAME` is accepted and ignored, as `CLIENT SETINFO` already was.

Two deliberate limits:

- `AUTH` inside `HELLO` is refused rather than supported. barch's `AUTH` replies `OK`
  on success and there is no way to run it from inside `HELLO` without that `OK`
  landing in front of the handshake and corrupting the reply. Separating the
  authentication from the reply would mean refactoring `auth_api.cpp`, which is out of
  proportion to the benefit: the `HELLO AUTH` form is only reachable for a RESP2
  client that also has credentials, and such a client can send `AUTH` as its own
  command. Clients are told so in the error.
- A RESP3 client still cannot connect. It now gets a correct, diagnostic `NOPROTO`
  instead of `unknown command`, but the connection still fails, because redis-py
  rejects a handshake whose `proto` does not match what it asked for. Closing that gap
  needs real RESP3 in the writer and is carried forward as `TODO.md` entry 9.

Covered by the HELLO section of `replyshapetest.py`: field presence and pairing at
both `HELLO` and `HELLO 2`, `proto` being 2, `modules` arriving as a nested empty
array, `NOPROTO` for versions 3, 1 and 0, the non numeric error, `SETNAME` accepted
and an unknown option rejected.
