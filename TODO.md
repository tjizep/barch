11. [Done] ZCOUNT registered, the other three documented as deliberate [26-07-2026] Nr 11

12. [Done] The asynchronous call path started a second read chain [26-07-2026] Nr 12

13. [Done] Same defect as entry 12, diagnosed there [26-07-2026] Nr 12


14. [Done] The filtered key borrowed a shared per thread buffer [01-08-2026] Nr 14

15. [Done] The hash set looked keys up through a thread_local side channel [01-08-2026] Nr 13

16. [Done] The lower bound trace was read back out of a thread_local [01-08-2026] Nr 15

17. [Done] Remaining API files converted onto the sharding layer [01-08-2026] Nr 17

18. [Done] SCAN cursor split between the connection and the store [01-08-2026] Nr 18

19. [Done] Sharding layer defined and keys_api converted onto it [01-08-2026] Nr 16

20. Key space administration - KSPACE DEPENDS / MERGE / RELEASE - locks two key spaces
    at once, in a hand chosen order, and sharded_store models a single space. Decide
    whether a cross space lock ordering belongs in the layer (a free function taking
    two stores, say) or stays where it is. Nothing is known to be wrong today; the
    concern is that the ordering rule that avoids deadlock is written out at each site
    rather than in one place. `barch::all_shards`, which walks every space, is the
    same question.

21. [Done] SIZE and HEAPBYTES relaxed to read locks [01-08-2026] Nr 19

22. [Done] Every command moved into a {category}_api file [01-08-2026] Nr 25

23. [Done] CLIENT LIST implemented [01-08-2026] Nr 22

24. [Done] Redis configuration names, and the other CONFIG subcommands [01-08-2026] Nr 23

25. [Done] PING renamed to RPING and redis's PING added [01-08-2026] Nr 24

26. INFO with no arguments answers "not implemented". INFO <section> works - memory,
    commandstats and the rest - but the bare form every client sends on connect, and
    that redis-cli's own INFO uses, falls through to the error at the end of
    barch::INFO. Found while testing CONFIG RESETSTAT. What is uncertain is only which
    sections the default should contain: redis returns a documented default set rather
    than everything, so settle by checking what redis-py's INFO parser and redis-cli
    expect to find, then join those sections.
