### Notes on ZFASTRANK

ZFastRank employs a newly developed constant time algorithm for determining rank in a sorted or ordered set.
The algorithm makes use of trace paths and cumulative nodes to calculate the node count between arbitrary boundaries in constant time on ART's (Adaptive Radix Trees).
This algorithm is currently unknown to academia or other entities.
